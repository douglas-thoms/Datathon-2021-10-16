Hypotheses to test
'hashtag choice of words impact engagement'
'hashtag absent reduces engagement'
'time of tweets impacts engagement'
'different industries impact have different hashtags and time of tweets - different profiles'
'the most successful tweets are in the same industries'




What is engagement? Any interaction with a tweet
Why is engagement wanted? Engagement can be wanted for many reasons - to get a specific action like attend an event or bring awareness of an issue or a position.  Common point is visibility is increased.

What are the metrics measuring engagement? (no priority)
for tweet
-favourite count
-retweet count

for overall performance (where are they now - may point to who is more successful)
follower count when tweets extracted
friends count when tweets extracted

Lots of work would be needed to classify different tweets to different intents.  Under current requirements, its best to assume that the motivation for engagement is visibility?



Observations:
-not all tweets have hashtags - research suggests that's important, does it impact hashtags

Observable data
-types of posts (available but limited - has media, is quote, is reply, is retweet)
-contains a URL, number of Urls (available)
-organize, type of organization (available)
-sentiment (available but difficult)
-time of tweet (available)
-followers that engaged (not avaiable)
-growth in followers (not available)
-organization location (available)

Questions:
-what kind of hashtags are ideal?
-can we determine the geography of where the tweets were engaged with?  for different organization geography is different - some like LGBQT are probably happy with a global reach, but not as useful for local libraries
-what times are best? (available)
-when were these tweets made?
-who is their audience? who are they attracting?
What are the common themes for posts that drive engagement ?
what are sentiments? (available - might be too complex)
how have friends, etc increased in time?
when did they start tweeting?
how do I determine the type of media?


Phase 1 - focus on time, hashtag and industry
